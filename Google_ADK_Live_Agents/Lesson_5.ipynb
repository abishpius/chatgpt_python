    "## 5.3 Callbacks\n",
    "\n",
    "Now you'll implement the core of this lesson: **callback-based control mechanisms**. Callbacks are Python functions that run at specific checkpoints in an agent's lifecycle, providing programmatic control over behavior.\n",

    "### Understanding ADK Callback types\n",
    "\n",
    "ADK provides several callback points:\n",
    "- **before_agent_callback**: Runs before agent execution starts\n",
    "- **after_agent_callback**: Runs after agent execution completes  \n",
    "- **before_tool_callback**: Runs before any tool is executed\n",
    "- **after_tool_callback**: Runs after any tool completes\n",

    "#### How It Works:\n",

    "  1. **Interception**: Runs before every `google_search` tool call\n",
    "  2. **Query analysis**: Examines the search query for blocked domains\n",

    "1. **Callback trigger**: Monitors when `google_search` tools finish execution.\n",
    "2. **Domain extraction**: Automatically parses URLs from search results to identify source domains.\n",
    "3. **State management**: Maintains a persistent log across multiple tool calls using `tool_context.state`.\n",
    "4. **Response transformation**: Converts simple string responses into structured data with metadata.\n",
    "5. **Write to the report**: Makes callback actions visible to the LLM through process logs. This log is written to the generated markdown report.\n",
