    "## 4.3 The Coordinator-Dispatcher Architecture Pattern\n",
    "In this lesson, you'll be implementing a sophisticated architectural pattern that separates user interaction from background processing. This pattern is essential for production AI systems.\n",
    "\n",
    "### The Challenge: Information Overload\n",
    "In previous lessons, your agent would research news and immediately read all findings to the user. This creates several problems:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Cognitive overload**: Users get overwhelmed with raw research data  \n",
    "- **Poor user experience**: Long delays while listening to unfiltered information  \n",
    "- **Inefficient workflows**: No separation between data gathering and content creation  \n",
    "\n",
    "### The Solution: Coordinator-Dispatcher Pattern\n",
    "The coordinator-dispatcher pattern solves this by implementing a two-phase workflow:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Coordination Phase**: Root agent acknowledges the request and coordinates background work  \n",
    "2. **Execution Phase**: Agent silently executes research, analysis, and file persistence  \n",
    "\n",
    "### Implementation Strategy\n",
    "You'll add a save_news_to_markdown tool that:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Takes research from google_search and get_financial_context  \n",
    "- Structures the data into a readable markdown report  \n",
    "- Saves results as ai_research_report.md  \n",
    "- Enables the root agent to work as a coordinator, not a presenter  \n",
    "\n",
    "This architectural shift prepares you for the podcast generation system you'll build in later lessons.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Financial Context Tool: Reusing Existing Components\n",
