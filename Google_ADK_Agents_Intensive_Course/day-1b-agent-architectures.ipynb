What if there was a way to break down your biggest development challenges by thinking not about a single, monolithic program, but about a collaborative team of intelligent \"agents\"? Welcome to the world of multi-agent systems (MAS), and discover how they can revolutionize your software development workflow.\n\n#### **Main Sections:**\n\n1.  **Tackling Complexity: Divide and Conquer (with Smarts!)**\n    *   **Decomposition of Problems:** MAS allows you to break down large, complex software problems into smaller, more manageable, and independent agent tasks. Each agent can focus on a specific, well-defined role.\n    *   **Enhanced Modularity & Reusability:** Agents can be designed, developed, tested, and deployed independently, leading to more modular codebases and the potential for agents to be reused across different projects.\n    *   **Easier Maintenance & Debugging:** Isolating issues within specific agents significantly simplifies the debugging and maintenance process, reducing the \"spaghetti code\" nightmare.\n\n2.  **Building Robust & Resilient Systems**\n    *   **Fault Tolerance:** If one agent fails, the system can often continue to operate by reassigning tasks or compensating for the lost functionality through other agents. This leads to more reliable software.\n    *   **Adaptability to Dynamic Environments:** Agents can sense their environment and react to changes, allowing the system as a whole to adapt in real-time to unexpected events or shifting requirements.\n    *   **Scalability:** As your system grows, you can simply add more agents with specialized roles or increase the number of instances of existing agents to handle increased load.\n\n3.  **Unlocking Intelligent Behavior & Collaboration**\n    *   **Emergent Intelligence:** The interaction and coordination between simple agents can lead to sophisticated, emergent behaviors that are difficult to achieve with traditional programming.\n    *   **Distributed Decision-Making:** Agents can make local decisions based on their own knowledge and goals, contributing to a more decentralized and efficient overall system.\n    *   **Cooperative and Competitive Interactions:** Design agents that can collaborate to achieve a common goal or compete to optimize a specific outcome, leading to powerful optimization and problem-solving capabilities.\n\n#### **Concluding Thought:**\nMulti-agent systems aren't just a theoretical concept; they're a practical paradigm shift that empowers developers to build more intelligent, resilient, and scalable software. By embracing the principles of agent-based design and interaction, you can move beyond solo efforts and create systems that are greater than the sum of their parts, truly embodying the power of distributed intelligence.\nWriterAgent > ## Beyond Solo Coding: Unleash Superpowers with Multi-Agent Systems\n\nEver felt like you're juggling too many tasks, drowning in complexity, or wishing your software could be more adaptable and intelligent? What if there was a way to break down your biggest development challenges by thinking not about a single, monolithic program, but about a collaborative team of intelligent \"agents\"? Welcome to the world of multi-agent systems (MAS), and discover how they can revolutionize your software development workflow.\n\nMAS allows you to **tackle complexity by dividing and conquering**. Instead of one giant codebase, you break down problems into smaller, manageable tasks, each handled by an independent agent. This dramatically enhances modularity and reusability, making development, testing, and maintenance far simpler. Imagine an agent for user authentication, another for data processing – their independence means debugging one doesn't send ripples through the entire system.\n\nBeyond just simplifying, MAS builds **robust and resilient systems**. If one agent encounters an issue, others can often pick up the slack, ensuring fault tolerance. These systems are also incredibly adaptable to dynamic environments, with agents sensing changes and reacting in real-time. As your needs grow, scalability is inherent; simply add more agents or replicate existing ones to handle increased load.\n\nPerhaps most exciting is the potential for **unlocking intelligent behavior and collaboration**. The interaction between simple agents can lead to sophisticated, emergent intelligence that's hard to achieve with traditional methods. Agents can make decentralized decisions, and you can design them to cooperate towards a common goal or even compete to optimize outcomes, leading to powerful problem-solving capabilities.\n\nMulti-agent systems are a practical paradigm shift.

You've seen how parallel agents can dramatically speed up workflows by running independent tasks concurrently.\n\nSo far, all our workflows run from start to finish and then stop. **But what if you need to review and improve an output multiple times?** Next, we'll build a workflow that can loop and refine its own work.","metadata":{}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"---\n## ➰ Section 5: Loop Workflows - The Refinement Cycle\n\n**The Problem: One-Shot Quality**\n\nAll the workflows we've seen so far run from start to finish. The `SequentialAgent` and `ParallelAgent` produce their final output and then stop. This 'one-shot' approach isn't good for tasks that require refinement and quality control. What if the first draft of our story is bad? We have no way to review it and ask for a rewrite.\n\n**The Solution: Iterative Refinement**\n\nWhen a task needs to be improved through cycles of feedback and revision, you can use a `LoopAgent`. A `LoopAgent` runs a set of sub-agents repeatedly *until a specific condition is met or a maximum number of iterations is reached.* This creates a refinement cycle, allowing the agent system to improve its own work over and over.\n\n**Use Loop when:** Iterative improvement is needed, quality refinement matters, or you need repeated cycles.\n\nTo learn more, check out the documentation related to [loop agents in ADK](https://google.github.io/adk-docs/agents/workflow-agents/loop-agents/).\n\n**Architecture: Story Writing & Critique Loop**\n\n<!--\n```mermaid\ngraph TD\n    A[\"Initial Prompt\"] -- > B[\"Writer Agent\"]\n    B -- >|story| C[\"Critic Agent\"]\n    C -- >|critique| D{\"Iteration < Max<br>AND<br>Not Approved?\"}\n    D -- >|Yes| B\n    D -- >|No| E[\"Final Story\"]\n\n    style B fill:#ccffcc\n    style C fill:#ffcccc\n    style D fill:#ffffcc\n```\n-->","metadata":{"id":"fP4I3mvtBtHF"}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"<img width=\"250\" src=\"https://storage.googleapis.com/github-repo/kaggle-5days-ai/day1/loop-agent.png\" alt=\"Loop Agent\" />","metadata":{}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"### 5.1 Example: Iterative Story Refinement\n\nLet's build a system with two agents:\n\n1. **Writer Agent** - Writes a draft of a short story\n2. **Critic Agent** - Reviews and critiques the short story to suggest improvements","metadata":{"id":"fP4I3mvtBtHF"}},{"cell_type":"code","source":"# This agent runs ONCE at the beginning to create the first draft.\ninitial_writer_agent = Agent(\n    name=\"InitialWriterAgent\",\n    model=Gemini(\n        model=\"gemini-2.5-flash-lite\",\n        retry_options=retry_config\n    ),\n    instruction=\"\"\"Based on the user's prompt, write the first draft of a short story (around 100-150 words).\n    Output only the story text, with no introduction or explanation.\"\"\",\n    output_key=\"current_story\",  # Stores the first draft in the state.\n)\n\nprint(\"✅ initial_writer_agent created.\")","metadata":{"id":"a2b8WlJoBtHF","outputId":"13ed1e15-dcf9-4e1d-ad1e-fb18ee793de5","trusted":true,"execution":{"iopub.status.busy":"2025-11-11T00:59:35.189066Z","iopub.execute_input":"2025-11-11T00:59:35.189393Z","iopub.status.idle":"2025-11-11T00:59:35.195212Z","shell.execute_reply.started":"2025-11-11T00:59:35.189372Z","shell.execute_reply":"2025-11-11T00:59:35.194267Z"}},"outputs":[{"name":"stdout","text":"✅ initial_writer_agent created.\n","output_type":"stream"}],"execution_count":19},{"cell_type":"code","source":"# This agent's only job is to provide feedback or the approval signal.

For instance, \"For thirty years, the lighthouse had been his world, a solitary sentinel against the churning sea, a life chosen after a tempest of a different kind had swept through his past.\"\n\n2.  **Enhance the map's mystery:** The description of the symbols is good, but consider adding a sensory detail beyond light. Does the map hum faintly? Does it feel unnaturally warm or cool to the touch? Does the phosphorescence shift in intensity or color in response to something specific? This could further elevate its enigmatic nature.\n\n3.  **Introduce a subtle foreshadowing or consequence:** The final sentence suggests a new purpose for Elias and the lighthouse. To make this feel more earned, you could subtly hint at it earlier, or introduce a very small, immediate consequence of him touching the map. Perhaps a sudden, strange fog rolls in, or the lighthouse beam flickers unexpectedly, hinting that the map's discovery has already altered Elias's reality.\nRefinerAgent > Elias polished the brass railing, the salt spray a familiar kiss on his weathered cheeks.
