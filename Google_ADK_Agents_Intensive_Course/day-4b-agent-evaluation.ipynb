This is where User Simulation comes in.\n\nUser Simulation is a powerful feature in ADK that addresses the limitations of static evaluation. Instead of using pre-defined, fixed user prompts, User Simulation employs a generative AI model (like Gemini) to **dynamically generate user prompts during the evaluation process.**\n\n### ❓ How it works\n\n* You define a `ConversationScenario` that outlines the user's overall conversational goals and a `conversation_plan` to guide the dialogue.\n* A large language model (LLM) then acts as a simulated user, using this plan and the ongoing conversation history to generate realistic and varied prompts.\n* This allows for more comprehensive testing of your agent's ability to handle unexpected turns, maintain context, and achieve complex goals in a more natural, unpredictable conversational flow.\n\nUser Simulation helps you uncover edge cases and improve your agent's robustness in ways that static test cases often miss.\n\n### 👉 Exercise\n\nNow that you understand the power of User Simulation for dynamic agent evaluation, here's an exercise to apply it:\n\nApply the **User Simulation** feature to your agent. Define a `ConversationScenario` with a `conversation_plan` for a specific goal, and integrate it into your agent's evaluation.\n\n**⭐ Refer to this [documentation](https://google.github.io/adk-docs/evaluate/user-sim/) to learn how to do it.**","metadata":{}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"## 🏆 Congratulations!\n\n### You've learned\n\n- ✅ Interactive test creation and analysis in the ADK web UI\n- ✅ Tool trajectory and response metrics\n- ✅ Automated regression testing using `adk eval` CLI command\n- ✅ How to analyze evaluation results and fix agents based on it\n\n**ℹ️ Note: No submission required!**\n\nThis notebook is for your hands-on practice and learning only.
