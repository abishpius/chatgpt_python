Drug discovery is one of the most dynamic areas where AI is making a significant impact. Here are some of the latest developments and trends:\n\n**1. Accelerated Target Identification and Validation:**\n\n*   **Genomics and Proteomics Analysis:** AI algorithms are becoming exceptionally good at sifting through massive datasets of genomic, proteomic, and transcriptomic data to identify novel disease targets (genes, proteins, pathways) that were previously unknown or difficult to find.\n*   **Disease Mechanism Elucidation:** AI can help researchers understand complex disease mechanisms by modeling biological networks and identifying key nodes that, when modulated, could lead to therapeutic effects.\n*   **Predicting Target Druggability:** AI is being used to assess whether a newly identified target is likely to be \"druggable\" – meaning a molecule can effectively bind to it and produce a desired effect.\n\n**2. Novel Molecule Design and Optimization:**\n\n*   **Generative AI for De Novo Drug Design:** This is a huge area of advancement. Generative AI models (like those based on GANs or transformers) can design entirely new molecules from scratch with desired properties (e.g., binding affinity to a specific target, good pharmacokinetic profiles). This moves beyond just screening existing libraries.\n*   **Predicting Molecular Properties:** AI can rapidly predict various properties of potential drug candidates, including:\n    *   **Binding Affinity:** How strongly a molecule will bind to its target.\n    *   **Solubility and Permeability:** How well it will dissolve and cross biological membranes.\n    *   **Toxicity (ADMET properties):** Absorption, Distribution, Metabolism, Excretion, and Toxicity. This helps filter out problematic compounds early.\n    *   **Synthesizability:** How easy it will be to actually synthesize the designed molecule in a lab.\n*   **Optimizing Lead Compounds:** Once a promising \"lead\" compound is identified, AI can suggest modifications to improve its efficacy, safety, and delivery.\n\n**3. Revolutionizing Preclinical Research:**\n\n*   **Predicting Clinical Trial Success:** AI models are being developed to analyze preclinical data (in vitro and in vivo studies) and historical clinical trial data to predict the likelihood of a drug candidate succeeding in human trials. This can help de-risk the process.\n*   **In Silico Screening:** AI can perform virtual screening of billions of compounds against a target much faster and cheaper than traditional high-throughput screening methods.\n*   **Designing Better Animal Models:** AI can help optimize the design of animal models for preclinical testing to better reflect human diseases.\n\n**4. Advancements in Specific Therapeutic Areas:**\n\n*   **Oncology:** AI is heavily utilized to discover new cancer targets, design personalized cancer therapies based on tumor mutations, and predict patient responses to immunotherapy.\n*   **Neuroscience:** AI is showing promise in identifying targets for neurodegenerative diseases like Alzheimer's and Parkinson's, as well as for mental health conditions.\n*   **Infectious Diseases:** AI is being used to discover novel antibiotics and antivirals, especially in the face of rising antimicrobial resistance.\n\n**5. Key Players and Trends:**\n\n*   **Biotech Startups:** Numerous AI-focused biotech companies (e.g., Recursion Pharmaceuticals, Exscientia, Insitro, Atomwise) are at the forefront, raising significant funding and forging partnerships with big pharma.\n*   **Big Pharma Collaboration:** Major pharmaceutical companies are increasingly partnering with or acquiring AI drug discovery firms, or building their own internal AI capabilities.\n*   **Data Integration:** The ability to integrate diverse datasets (genomic, imaging, clinical, chemical) is crucial for training effective AI models.\n*   **Explainable AI (XAI):** While generative AI can design molecules, there's a growing emphasis on understanding *why* a particular molecule was designed, which aids in validation and regulatory processes.\n\n**Challenges that remain:**\n\n*   **Data Quality and Access:** High-quality, well-annotated biological data is essential, and access can be limited.\n*   **Experimental Validation:** AI-generated hypotheses and molecules still require rigorous experimental validation, which is time-consuming and expensive.\n*   **Regulatory Hurdles:** Adapting regulatory frameworks to the unique aspects of AI-driven drug discovery is an ongoing process.\n\nIn summary, AI is not just speeding up drug discovery; it's fundamentally changing how we approach it, enabling the design of entirely new therapeutic modalities and personalizing treatments in ways that were previously unimaginable.\n\n ### Session: compaction_demo\n\nUser > Tell me more about the second development you found.\ngemini-2.5-flash-lite >  You're asking about the **\"Novel Molecule Design and Optimization\"** aspect of AI in drug discovery. This is indeed a very exciting and rapidly advancing frontier. Let me elaborate on what this entails and the specific AI techniques involved.\n\nAt its core, this development is about using AI to create entirely new drug-like molecules (hence \"de novo design\") or to significantly improve existing ones. Before AI, this process was largely reliant on:\n\n*   **Screening vast libraries of existing compounds:** This is like searching for a specific key among millions of pre-made ones. It's effective but limited by the diversity of the library.\n*   **Rational drug design based on established principles:** This involves understanding the target and manually designing molecules that might fit, often through trial and error and extensive chemical knowledge.\n\nAI, particularly deep learning, is revolutionizing this by enabling computers to **learn the rules and patterns of chemistry and biology** and then use that knowledge to *generate* novel solutions.\n\nHere are the key aspects and AI techniques within Novel Molecule Design and Optimization:\n\n**1. De Novo Drug Design (Designing from Scratch):**\n\n*   **What it is:** AI models are trained on massive datasets of known molecules and their properties. They then learn the underlying chemical grammar – how atoms bond, what makes a molecule stable, soluble, able to bind to a target, etc. Based on this learned knowledge, they can generate entirely new molecular structures that have never existed before.\n*   **AI Techniques Used:**\n    *   **Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs):** These involve two neural networks: a \"generator\" that creates new molecules, and a \"discriminator\" that tries to distinguish between real molecules (from training data) and fake ones (generated). Through this adversarial process, the generator gets better and better at creating realistic and promising molecules.\n    *   **Variational Autoencoders (VAEs):** VAEs learn a compressed representation (a \"latent space\") of molecules. By sampling from this latent space and decoding, they can generate novel molecular structures.\n    *   **Reinforcement Learning (RL):** RL can be used to guide the generation process. The AI agent \"builds\" a molecule step-by-step, receiving rewards for desired properties (e.g., high binding affinity, good solubility) and penalties for undesirable ones.\n    *   **Transformer Networks:** Originally developed for natural language processing, transformers are now being adapted for molecules. They can treat molecules as sequences of \"words\" (chemical representations) and learn complex relationships between different parts of the molecule.\n\n**2. Predicting Molecular Properties:**\n\n*   **What it is:** Even if a molecule is novel, it needs to have the right characteristics to be a successful drug. AI models are trained to predict these crucial properties with high accuracy.\n*   **Key Properties Predicted:**\n    *   **Binding Affinity:** How strongly the molecule will interact with its intended biological target (e.g., a protein enzyme or receptor). This is often the primary goal.\n    *   **ADMET Properties:**\n        *   **Absorption:** How well it's absorbed into the body.\n        *   **Distribution:** Where it goes in the body.\n        *   **Metabolism:** How the body breaks it down.\n        *   **Excretion:** How it's removed from the body.\n        *   **Toxicity:** Whether it's harmful.\n        Predicting these early is vital to avoid wasting time and resources on compounds that will fail later.\n    *   **Solubility:** Its ability to dissolve in water, which affects absorption.\n    *   **Permeability:** Its ability to cross cell membranes.\n    *   **Synthesizability:** Whether a chemist can actually build this molecule in a lab using known reactions. This is a crucial practical consideration.\n*   **AI Techniques Used:**\n    *   **Graph Neural Networks (GNNs):** Molecules are naturally represented as graphs (atoms are nodes, bonds are edges). GNNs are excellent at learning from these graph structures and predicting properties.\n    *   **Deep Neural Networks (DNNs) / Multi-Layer Perceptrons (MLPs):** Standard deep learning architectures are used, often trained on large datasets of molecules with known properties.\n    *   **Quantitative Structure-Activity Relationship (QSAR) models:** AI is advancing traditional QSAR by using more complex features and models to relate molecular structure to biological activity.\n\n**3. Optimization of Existing Compounds (Lead Optimization):**\n\n*   **What it is:** Once a promising compound (\"lead\") is found, it's rarely perfect. AI can suggest specific modifications to improve its performance. For example, if a compound binds well but has poor solubility, AI can suggest modifications to increase solubility while maintaining binding affinity.\n*   **AI Techniques Used:** Similar generative models and property predictors can be used in an iterative fashion. The AI takes a lead compound, proposes variations, predicts their properties, and helps select the best candidates for further testing. This is like fine-tuning an existing instrument to get the perfect sound.\n\n**Why this is revolutionary:**\n\n*   **Vastly Increased Chemical Space Exploration:** AI can explore a much larger and more diverse chemical space than traditional methods.\n*   **Speed and Efficiency:** Designing and screening molecules computationally is orders of magnitude faster than wet-lab experiments.\n*   **Novelty:** AI can generate molecules with completely novel scaffolds that human chemists might not have conceived of.\n*   **Data-Driven Insights:** AI can uncover subtle structure-activity relationships that are not immediately obvious to human intuition.\n\nCompanies are using these techniques to design molecules for targets that were previously considered \"undruggable\" or to find entirely new ways to tackle diseases. It's a powerful synergy of computational power and biological understanding.\n\n ### Session: compaction_demo\n\nUser > Who are the main companies involved in that?\ngemini-2.5-flash-lite >  The landscape of companies involved in AI-driven de novo drug design and molecule optimization is dynamic and includes a mix of specialized AI biotech startups and established pharmaceutical giants.

The presence of that special summary `Event` in your session's history is the tangible result of the compaction process.\n\n**Let's recap what you just witnessed:**\n\n1.  **Silent Operation**: You ran a standard conversation, and from the outside, nothing seemed different.\n2.  **Background Compaction**: Because you configured the `App` with `EventsCompactionConfig`, the ADK `Runner` automatically monitored the conversation length. Once the threshold was met, it triggered the summarization process in the background.\n3.  **Verified Result**: By inspecting the session's events, you found the summary that the LLM generated. This summary now replaces the older, more verbose turns in the agent's active context.\n\n**For all future turns in this conversation, the agent will be given this concise summary instead of the full history.** This saves costs, improves performance, and helps the agent stay focused on what's most important.\n","metadata":{}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"### 4.5 More Context Engineering options in ADK\n\n#### 👉 Custom Compaction\nIn this example, we used ADK's default summarizer. For more advanced use cases, you can provide your own by defining a custom `SlidingWindowCompactor` and passing it to the config. This allows you to control the summarization prompt or even use a different, specialized LLM for the task. You can read more about it in the [official documentation](https://google.github.io/adk-docs/context/compaction/).\n\n#### 👉 Context Caching\nADK also provides **Context Caching** to help reduce the token size of the static instructions that are fed to the LLM by caching the request data.
