Callbacks are **Python functions** you define and attach to agents - ADK automatically calls them at specific stages, acting like checkpoints during the agent's execution flow.\n\n**Think of callbacks as event listeners in your agent's lifecycle.** When an agent processes a request, it goes through multiple stages: receiving the input, calling the LLM, invoking tools, and generating the response. Callbacks let you insert custom logic at each of these stages without modifying the core agent code.\n\n**Available callback types:**\n\n- `before_agent_callback` → Runs before agent starts processing a request\n- `after_agent_callback` → Runs after agent completes its turn  \n- `before_tool_callback` / `after_tool_callback` → Around tool invocations\n- `before_model_callback` / `after_model_callback` → Around LLM calls\n- `on_model_error_callback` → When errors occur\n\n**Common use cases:**\n\n- Logging and observability (track what the agent does)\n- Automatic data persistence (like saving to memory)\n- Custom validation or filtering\n- Performance monitoring\n\n**📚 Learn More:** [ADK Callbacks Documentation](https://google.github.io/adk-docs/agents/callbacks/)","metadata":{}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"![image.png](https://storage.googleapis.com/github-repo/kaggle-5days-ai/day4/types_of_callbacks.png)","metadata":{}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"### 6.2 Automatic Memory Storage with Callbacks\n\nFor automatic memory storage, we'll use `after_agent_callback`.

That's where `callback_context` comes in.\n\nWhen you define a callback function, ADK automatically passes a special parameter called `callback_context` to it. The `callback_context` provides access to the Memory Service and other runtime components.\n\n**How we'll use it:** In our callback, we'll access the memory service and current session to automatically save conversation data after each turn.\n\n**💡 Important:** You don't create this context - ADK creates it and passes it to your callback automatically when the callback runs.","metadata":{}},{"cell_type":"code","source":"async def auto_save_to_memory(callback_context):\n    \"\"\"Automatically save session to memory after each agent turn.\"\"\"\n    await callback_context._invocation_context.memory_service.add_session_to_memory(\n        callback_context._invocation_context.session\n    )\n\n\nprint(\"✅ Callback created.\")","metadata":{"trusted":true,"execution":{"iopub.status.busy":"2025-11-13T00:54:30.118493Z","iopub.execute_input":"2025-11-13T00:54:30.118728Z","iopub.status.idle":"2025-11-13T00:54:30.142110Z","shell.execute_reply.started":"2025-11-13T00:54:30.118710Z","shell.execute_reply":"2025-11-13T00:54:30.140976Z"}},"outputs":[{"name":"stdout","text":"✅ Callback created.\n","output_type":"stream"}],"execution_count":20},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"### 6.3 Create an Agent: Callback and PreLoad Memory Tool\n\nNow create an agent that combines:\n- **Automatic storage:** `after_agent_callback` saves conversations\n- **Automatic retrieval:** `preload_memory` loads memories\n\nThis creates a fully automated memory system with zero manual intervention.","metadata":{}},{"cell_type":"code","source":"# Agent with automatic memory saving\nauto_memory_agent = LlmAgent(\n    model=Gemini(model=\"gemini-2.5-flash-lite\", retry_options=retry_config),\n    name=\"AutoMemoryAgent\",\n    instruction=\"Answer user questions.\",\n    tools=[preload_memory],\n    after_agent_callback=auto_save_to_memory,  # Saves after each turn!\n)\n\nprint(\"✅ Agent created with automatic memory saving!\")","metadata":{"trusted":true,"execution":{"iopub.status.busy":"2025-11-13T00:54:30.556705Z","iopub.execute_input":"2025-11-13T00:54:30.557515Z","iopub.status.idle":"2025-11-13T00:54:30.563880Z","shell.execute_reply.started":"2025-11-13T00:54:30.557485Z","shell.execute_reply":"2025-11-13T00:54:30.562409Z"}},"outputs":[{"name":"stdout","text":"✅ Agent created with automatic memory saving!\n","output_type":"stream"}],"execution_count":21},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"**What happens automatically:**\n\n- After every agent response → callback triggers\n- Session data → transferred to memory\n- No manual `add_session_to_memory()` calls needed\n\nThe framework handles everything!","metadata":{}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"### 6.4 Create a Runner and Test The Agent\n\nTime to test!
