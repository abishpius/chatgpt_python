An agent can do more than just respond to a prompt — it can **take actions** to find information or get things done.\n\nIn this notebook, you'll:\n\n- ✅ Install [Agent Development Kit (ADK)](https://google.github.io/adk-docs/)\n- ✅ Configure your API key to use the Gemini model\n- ✅ Build your first simple agent\n- ✅ Run your agent and watch it use a tool (like Google Search) to answer a question\n\n## ‼️ Please Read\n\n> ❌ **ℹ️ Note: No submission required!**\n> This notebook is for your hands-on practice and learning only. You **do not** need to submit it anywhere to complete the course.\n\n> ⏸️ **Note:**  When you first start the notebook via running a cell you might see a banner in the notebook header that reads **\"Waiting for the next available notebook\"**.

You've just seen the core concept of agent development in action.\n\nThe big takeaway is that your agent didn't just *respond*—it **reasoned** that it needed more information and then **acted** by using a tool. This ability to take action is the foundation of all agent-based AI.\n\n**ℹ️ Note: No submission required!**\n\nThis notebook is for your hands-on practice and learning only.
